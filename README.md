# RFID-Based-Voting-Machine
The RFID-based voting machine is designed to provide a secure and efficient voting process by using RFID cards as unique voter IDs. Each voter is authenticated through their RFID card, preventing duplicate or fraudulent voting. Once validated, the voter can cast their vote electronically. It ensures transparency and accuracy.


Features
1.Secure voting using unique RFID cards
2.Prevents duplicate or unauthorized votes
3.Automatic storage and counting of votes
4.Simple and user-friendly design
5.Faster and more transparent election process

Components Used
-Arduino UNO
-RFID Reader & RFID Tags
-LCD Display (for instructions and results)
-Buzzer/LED (for feedback)
-Push Buttons (for vote casting)

How It Works
-Each voter receives an RFID card assigned to them.
-The RFID card is scanned by the reader.
-The system verifies the card and allows the voter to cast their vote.
-Once the vote is cast, it is stored securely and the voter cannot vote again.
-At the end, the system displays the results instantly.

Future Improvements
-Integration with a database for large-scale elections
-Use of biometric authentication along with RFID
-Web/Mobile-based result monitoring
